# Pattern Lab - RI Gov
This is the decoupled pattern lab library for RI.gov. The foundation for this respository was built using: Pattern Lab Node - Gulp Edition | The Gulp wrapper around [Pattern Lab Node Core](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/tree/master/packages/core).

From there we have made a quite a few modifications:
* Converted the engine to use Twig rendering engine
* Pulled in a custom source directory
* Upgraded the gulp file to use Gulp 4
* Added custom JS and SASS compiling.

## Getting Started

> Notice: This repository is stand-alone in the sense that you may develop the RI Gov Pattern Lab with no other dependencies.

To get up and running:

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm ci
```

### Gulp Commands

```bash
gulp
```
The `default` gulp command builds the js, sass, and serves the pattern lab server. It also calls `gulp watch` which will detect any changes and re-build.

```bash
gulp watch
```

Running `gulp watch`  which will monitor your `/source` directory for any changes. If it detects a change to either .js, .scss, .twig files it will call the relevant build function.

```bash
gulp build
```

Running `gulp build` builds all js, scss, and patterns.

```bash
gulp build:no-patterns
```

Running `gulp build:no-patterns` excludes patterns from being built but will compile js and scss.

### Compiled Assets

Assets are compliled to two locations:

`/dist` - folder contains a js and css folder with compiled assets. This is the directory Drupal will use to pull in assets.

`/public/` - Public directory is generated by Pattern Lab. The CSS directory inside of this contains the same assets as `/source/css`. The JS directory is the same as `source/js`.
