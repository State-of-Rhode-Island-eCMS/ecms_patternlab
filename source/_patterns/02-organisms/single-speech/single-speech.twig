<p>Speaker Mattiello, Senate President Ruggerio, members of the House and Senate; members of the  Judiciary; my Cabinet, my wonderful family; and my fellow Rhode Islanders.  Thank you for trusting me to deliver results for our great state. </p>
<p>Tonight, I stand  before you truly optimistic about our future. In the past few years, we’ve dug  our way out of a deep economic hole and are preparing Rhode Islanders for  success in a fast-changing economy. </p>
<p>Right now in Rhode  Island, we have more than half a million jobs. That’s more jobs than at any  time ever in our state’s history. Unemployment is at its lowest point in three  decades. </p>
<p>Just think about  that. That means our economy today is the strongest it’s been in a generation.  It hasn’t always been that way. In fact, a few years ago our neighboring states  had strong economies, but we didn’t. So what’s changed? </p>
<p>What’s changed is  that we’ve put aside the old way of doing business and we’re working together  to tackle our biggest challenges. And because of our hard work, the state of  our state is strong. </p>
<p>Now what we have  to do is maintain that economic momentum into the future. We need to stick with  what is working – like investing in job training and education, and  guaranteeing affordable, quality healthcare for all Rhode Islanders. But we  also have to embrace innovation in all that we do, from the jobs we bring here  to the way we run our government.</p>
<p>We’re changing  lives and making Rhode Island more competitive. Our new approach is a proven  success. </p>
<p>A couple years ago  in the midst of setbacks, we deepened our commitment to the Blackstone Valley,  and it’s beginning to pay off. A few months ago, we cut the ribbon on a new  manufacturing training center at Davies High School in Lincoln. We are finally  building the Pawtucket-Central Falls rail station. And a few weeks ago, we  announced the largest economic development project in Pawtucket’s history,  including a new professional soccer stadium. It will revive downtown and create  thousands of jobs. </p>
<p>For years, the  land made available when we moved Route 195 was just a vacant lot. Today, it’s  home to a vibrant Innovation Center – a physical symbol of our economic future.</p>
<p>We’ve made it  easier to do business in Rhode Island, cutting thousands of pages of  regulations and providing 120 loans to small business – more than half of which  have gone to women and minority-owned businesses. That small business loan fund  didn’t even exist when I became governor. </p>
<p>We’ve added  thousands of jobs at the Quonset Business Park. Electric Boat just keeps on  growing, and more than two dozen companies have moved or expanded there. In  fact, Quonset is bursting at the seams and we need more industrial space.  Tonight, I’m announcing a bond to develop new industrial sites all across Rhode  Island. It’s a proven success. So let’s do more of it. </p>
<p>We’ve made all  this progress while cutting taxes every year. So let’s continue on that path by  cutting the car tax again this year for every single Rhode Islander. Let’s also  cut taxes for small businesses, who for almost 25 years saw no relief from  their unemployment insurance taxes. Tonight, I’m proud to announce the third  cut in unemployment insurance taxes since I took office. </p>
<p>Over the past few  years we’ve completely changed our approach to job training. We’ve worked in  partnership with hundreds of businesses. As a result, we’ve trained nearly seven  thousand Rhode Islanders for good careers. In fact, because of this new  approach, 7 out of 10 people trained find a good job right away.</p>
<p>For some, this  training has been truly life-changing. Take Jennifer Brown from Warwick. Like  my dad, Jennifer started her career in jewelry manufacturing. When those jobs  left Rhode Island, she got a job at a bank – until that job was eliminated.  Also like my dad, Jennifer was in her mid-50s and found herself looking for a  new career. Thanks to our new job training, she was able to start over. </p>
<p>Today Jennifer  works at Mearthane Products in Cranston. She says we gave her skills for a new  career. But, even more than that, she has confidence, hope, and optimism that  she never thought she’d have again.</p>
<p>Because of the  success of this new approach to job training, Rhode Island businesses are  calling on us to expand it. They tell us they need it to find the right talent.  So let’s do it. Tonight, I’m proposing expanding the Real Jobs RI initiative.  It has a proven track record of success. Can’t we all agree that every Rhode  Islander deserves a shot at getting a good job? </p>
<p>I also hear from  Rhode Islanders about the importance of transportation and infrastructure.  Businesses want to grow, and people want to live, in well-connected  communities.</p>
<p>Thanks to  RhodeWorks, we’re fixing our roads quicker than we ever have. Projects that  used to sit on the drawing board for years, like the 6-10 connector, are  finally under construction. In fact, in the last four years, we’ve fixed more  than 100 roads and bridges, and right  now, we’re fixing another 100.</p>
<p>Now, just imagine  what Rhode Island would look like if we improved our trains, buses, and public  transit the same way we’ve tackled fixing our roads and bridges. Imagine a day  when high speed commuter rail connects Providence to Boston; when electric  buses powered by solar panels zip through dedicated bus lanes.</p>
<p>That’s within our  grasp right now. It’s not 10 or 20 years down the road. It’s today. We came  together to change the way we invest in roads and bridges. Now let’s take that  same proven approach to improve our public transportation for every Rhode  Islander. </p>
<p>Let’s also invest  in our beaches, parks and in our drinking water. Like so many Rhode Islanders,  my family’s memories have been made on our beaches. Don’t you think it’s time  to renovate our tired bathrooms at our state beaches and fix the pavilions and concessions?  I think it’s time to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our beaches. </p>
<p>Millions flock to  our beaches every summer. So, let’s protect this beauty – the beauty that sets  Rhode Island apart. </p>
<p>And if we want to  ensure Rhode Island’s beauty is enjoyed for generations to come, we have to  address climate change with urgency.</p>
<p>About three years  ago I set an ambitious goal to increase our clean energy ten-fold by the end of  2020. Tonight, I’m proud to tell you that by the end of the year, we’ll exceed  that goal. We’re the nation’s leader in offshore wind, and in a few years,  we’ll have enough offshore wind energy to power half of the homes in Rhode  Island. It’s time to set our sights higher.</p>
<p>This week I’ll  sign an executive order to make Rhode Island the first state in America to be  powered by 100% renewable energy by the end of this decade. </p>
<p>You know, from the  day I became governor, so many people warned me to stay away from the toughest  challenges. They said: It might be too difficult, too controversial. Others  have already tried, and it hasn’t worked. But improving education for our  children cannot wait – and we cannot think small. I’m committed to doing  whatever it takes to set public education on a better path.</p>
<p>Now I know our  students are capable and our teachers are dedicated. I’ve been in classrooms  all over the state and I’ve seen great work happening. We need to build on  what’s working and fix what isn’t working.</p>
<p>We’re starting to  see some results. Last year Rhode Island saw improvements in third-grade  reading scores – a key indicator of a child’s future classroom success. But we  still lag behind Massachusetts. We’re behind because for decades our  decision-making lacked direction, and too often we shied away from the most  difficult decisions. Those days are over. We have a moral and an economic  obligation to do better by our kids. </p>
<p>Nowhere is our  challenge more obvious than in our capital city. Providence’s test scores last  year were a call to action for all of us. The deeper we dig, the more we see a  system in crisis. No consistent curriculum. Not enough student learning. Brown  drinking water. Bats in classrooms. </p>
<p>Our teachers and  our students are working hard every single day in a system that’s broken. They  deserve to know they’re not alone, and they deserve better. So we took action  with unprecedented state intervention. We’ve begun the hard work of  transforming a system that has failed students, teachers and families for  decades. </p>
<p>We’re moving to  high-quality curricula across the district; expanding career education and  college-level classes; making smarter investments in our buildings so everyone  can be safe. Most important, we will end the culture of low expectations for  our kids.</p>
<p>Students,  teachers, parents, and the community – you are the ones driving this change,  and I want to thank you. It’s only going to work if you stay at the table. </p>
<p>I also want you to  know our work is certainly not limited to Providence. We are every bit as  focused on improving outcomes for every child in every school district across  our state. We’re applying the lessons learned to make schools better  everywhere. Every single one of us has a stake in improving outcomes in all of  our schools. Ask yourself: What can I do to support the work? </p>
<p>We have to challenge  ourselves to see beyond the borders of our own city or town. Of course, we all  want the best for our own children. But we also all have a stake in the future  of the child in the next town or on the other side of the state. These kids are  our future – our future teachers, police officers, doctors, and computer  programmers.</p>
<p>Schools in every  community have to do better, so tonight, I am announcing an additional $30  million to support students and teachers in every community. In every district  across the state, we’ll invest in high-quality curricula and ensure more  students have access to advanced classes in high school. We’ll invest to  support multilingual learners for whom the playing field is still devastatingly  unequal. We’ll increase the number of mental health professionals in our  schools – so children’s learning needs are met.</p>
<p>We all know that  having a good teacher can change your life. So we’re going to do more to  support our teachers. That means providing them more professional development  and mental health training – and doing more to keep science and math teachers  in Rhode Island by helping them out with their student loans. </p>
<p>A very bright spot  in our education system is our public PreK. Rhode Island is a nationally  recognized leader. The problem is, for too many people, it’s unaffordable. Parents  of young children routinely spend a quarter of their income on childcare. In  fact, chances are if you’re a parent of two or three kids, you’re paying more  for child care than you are for your rent. </p>
<p>Ashleigh Ortiz  couldn’t afford it. She’s a working mom, who recently went back to school to  become a nurse. Her oldest son didn’t get to go to PreK because it was too  expensive. Her two younger children did, and they are thriving thanks to public  PreK classrooms in Woonsocket. </p>
<p>So let’s invest in  what we know works. Kids shouldn’t have to be lucky or rich to get a strong  start. Tonight, I’m proposing a more than 50% increase in the number of  high-quality public PreK classrooms throughout the state. That’s taking a big  step forward toward our goal of Universal PreK for every 4-year-old in Rhode  Island. </p>
<p>Now, in order to  do this, we actually need to build more high-quality classrooms. The lack of  available space is one of the greatest barriers to expanding PreK and  high-quality child care. Tonight, I’m calling for a bond to build these spaces  for our kids. Massachusetts broke through the barrier with a similar successful  program, and our kids deserve the same. </p>
<p>The only way to  give our children a shot at a bright future – and to give our businesses access  to talent that they need – is to make sure every Rhode Islander can continue  their education past high school. A few years ago, we tried something new to  help more young people get a college degree and training for a good job. We  enabled high school graduates to enroll at CCRI tuition-free. At that time, it  was an innovative approach few states had taken. But since then, more have  followed our lead.</p>
<p>Today, the Promise  Scholarship is a proven success. CCRI’s graduation rate has tripled. Statewide,  we hit a record: more students than ever are enrolling in college. In fact, our  very own CCRI recently earned the distinction of best two-year college in  America.</p>
<p>That’s the good  news. But there’s a risk. That scholarship is set to expire. If we don’t take  action now, this year’s high school seniors will be the last class of Promise  scholars. We’ll be pulling the rug right out from under all of our other high  school students, and we’ll be putting an end to a proven success.</p>
<p>Economic experts  agree the most important thing we can do to strengthen our economy is to have a  more educated workforce. We can’t go backward. Let’s make the Promise  Scholarship permanent and cement affordable higher education and job training  into the very foundation of our economy. </p>
<p>We can’t talk  about taking care of our children without thinking about our most vulnerable.  Too many kids in Rhode Island live without a stable, loving home. Many of them  live in the shadow of trauma or addiction. They arrive on our doorstep through  no fault of their own. We do what any of you would do. We take care of them.</p>
<p>Tonight, I am  proposing that we make additional investments to strengthen our child welfare  system so that we can meet our obligation to the kids in our care. This  investment will support our dedicated staff on the front lines, allow us to  recruit and license more foster families so we can get more kids out of group  homes, and make sure that no child remains in limbo a day longer than  necessary. </p>
<p>If children can’t  be reunited with their biological parents, it’s on us to find them a stable,  loving family that they can call their own. Tonight, I’m announcing a new  initiative to find and support more foster and adoptive homes. No one needs our  love more than these kids. This is my commitment, and I’m asking that you make  it yours too. </p>
<p>As every parent  knows, we also have to protect our kids from the risks of vaping. Last year,  facing a developing public health crisis, I took immediate action to  temporarily ban flavored e-cigarettes. Public health experts tell us these  dangers are real. Let’s make this ban permanent and protect our children. </p>
<p>When we say  everyone deserves a shot, that really means everyone. We’re doing that in Rhode  Island by securing access to health care. When I became governor, we decided to  keep running our own state health exchange instead of giving it to the federal  government. Because of that decision – and a lot of hard work – almost 97% of  Rhode Islanders have health insurance. That’s higher than almost any other  state. While premiums are increasing across the country, here in Rhode Island most premiums will  decrease this year on our exchange. No one should have to choose between going  to the doctor and buying groceries. </p>
<p>Since I’ve been governor,  we’ve raised the minimum wage three times. Our hardest working Rhode Islanders  deserve a raise. Let’s do it again this year. At the same time, let’s expand  the earned income tax credit so hardworking Rhode Islanders can keep more of  their money in their pockets. No one who works full time should live in  poverty. </p>
<p>No one should  struggle to keep a roof over their head either, and right now too many working  families do. This affects everyone: the young working couple who struggle to be  good employees because they don’t have stable housing; small businesses that  struggle to recruit people who are priced out of the community; even kids who  fall asleep in class because they slept on a relative’s couch the night before.</p>
<p>Our housing  shortage threatens all of the economic progress we’ve made. This year I propose  a housing bond and -- for the first time ever in Rhode Island -- a dedicated  funding stream to build more housing. Nearly every other state already has  this. Let’s do it, and let’s get to work building more homes. </p>
<p>Protecting our  future means protecting our neighborhoods, workplaces and schools from gun  violence. It’s a nationwide crisis that in the past few weeks has hit very  close to home in Westerly and Pawtucket. </p>
<p>Even one tragedy  with an untraceable, homemade firearm is one too many. Loopholes that allow  extremely dangerous people to get guns need to be closed. Military-style  assault weapons don’t belong in our communities and should be banned. So this  year, I will once again propose a comprehensive package of gun reforms. Stand  with me and keep Rhode Island safe.</p>
<p>As we tackle these  defining issues of our time, we need reforms that ensure citizens and  businesses have confidence in their leaders. That means it is time to pass line  item veto. </p>
<p>We know this is  something the vast majority of Rhode Islanders want. Nearly every other state  uses line item veto to reduce waste in government spending and corruption – and  to ensure that tax dollars help all citizens, not just those with connections. Let’s restore Rhode Islanders’ confidence in  government and put line item veto on the ballot. </p>
<p>As we sit here  tonight, imagine yourselves 20 years down the road. It’s 2040 in Rhode Island.  What do you see? Maybe your kids are grown. Maybe you’ve retired. Maybe you’ve  started a new career, bought a house or started a family. </p>
<p>I see a Rhode  Island where the opportunity for an excellent education from PreK to college is  guaranteed for everyone. Our public schools are thriving. Our economy is  booming because of our educated workforce. High-speed rail and electric buses  make it easy to commute across the state and across the region. </p>
<p>I see a Rhode  Island where young couples, unburdened by student loans, can afford to buy  their first home. Headlines about gun violence don’t fill the news anymore, and  everyone has access to health care. </p>
<p>We are on track to  make this vision a reality, and we’re going to get there if we continue to  invest in what works. So, let’s find the courage to stay on this path and  strengthen our state for decades to come. This bright future is ours if we  build it together.</p>
<p>Thank you. God  bless you, and God bless Rhode Island.</p>
